## Coursera Clean Data project

Code Book 

The cleaned dataset includes the following variables.


<Subject> - Integer number from 1 to 30 that represents the person that did the test

<Activity> - Factor that has the 6 different activities that each subject was doing:

1 WALKING

2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4 SITTING

5 STANDING

6 LAYING


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

This data was further refined into the mean of all samples from each subject for each activity and stored in:

tBodyAcc-mean()-X -  

tBodyAcc-mean()-Y

tBodyAcc-mean()-Z

tBodyAcc-std()-X

tBodyAcc-std()-Y

tBodyAcc-std()-Z

tGravityAcc-mean()-X

tGravityAcc-mean()-Y

tGravityAcc-mean()-Z

tGravityAcc-std()-X

tGravityAcc-std()-Y

tGravityAcc-std()-Z

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

This data was further refined into the mean of all samples from each subject for each activity and stored in:

tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X

tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y

tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z

tBodyAccJerk-std()-X

tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y

tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z

tBodyGyro-mean()-X

tBodyGyro-mean()-Y

tBodyGyro-mean()-Z

tBodyGyro-std()-X

tBodyGyro-std()-Y

tBodyGyro-std()-Z

tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X

tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y

tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z

tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X

tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y

tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z

tBodyAccMag-mean()

tBodyAccMag-std()

tGravityAccMag-mean()

tGravityAccMag-std()

tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()

tBodyAccJerkMag-std()

tBodyGyroMag-mean()

tBodyGyroMag-std()

tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()

tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

This data was further refined into the mean of all samples from each subject for each activity and stored in:

fBodyAcc-mean()-X
fBodyAcc-mean()-Y
fBodyAcc-mean()-Z
fBodyAcc-std()-X
fBodyAcc-std()-Y
fBodyAcc-std()-Z
fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X

fBodyAccJerk-std()-X
fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y
fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z
